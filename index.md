## About Me...

My name is Juan Pablo Perez Mejia, and I was born in Bucaramanga, Colombia. Growing up, I had the unique opportunity to live in several of Colombia’s major cities, including Barranquilla, Bogotá, Cali, and Medellín. These experiences gave me a deep appreciation for Colombia’s diverse cultures and shaped my adaptable and resilient character.

I attended The Columbus School in Medellín, where my passion for soccer flourished. As the leading goal scorer and captain of my school’s soccer team, I led my team to victory in the prestigious Binational Games, a national competition among American schools across Colombia. My dedication to soccer opened the door to an incredible opportunity—a scholarship to Knox College in the United States, where I continue to pursue both my academic and athletic goals.

At Knox, I’ve contributed over 1,500 minutes on the field across three seasons, scoring 4 goals and providing 7 assists. Despite overcoming injuries early in my collegiate career, I’ve demonstrated resilience and commitment, which earned me the honor of becoming captain of the Knox soccer team after my third season.

Outside of soccer, I have a passion for music, particularly electronic genres like Techno, Hard Techno, Groove, and Hard Groove. I began DJing in high school, performing live for various events, including my 12th-grade trip and prom. Over the years, I’ve honed my craft, sharing my sets on SoundCloud and performing at private events. Music is a creative outlet that fuels my energy and inspires me to connect with others.

Through soccer, music, and my experiences across Colombia and the U.S., I’ve developed a strong sense of leadership, creativity, and resilience. These values drive me to excel in all aspects of my life, and I’m excited to continue sharing my journey.
